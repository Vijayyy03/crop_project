Overview
The Crop Prediction System helps farmers and agricultural experts determine the most suitable crop to cultivate based on a variety of environmental and soil parameters. The app uses machine learning models trained on agricultural data to make accurate crop predictions. Users can input parameters such as soil composition, temperature, humidity, and rainfall to get personalized recommendations.

Features
Crop Prediction: Get recommendations on the best crop to cultivate based on real-time data inputs.
Interactive UI: A clean and intuitive interface built using Streamlit.
Dynamic FAQ and Contact Sections: Users can view frequently asked questions and send messages for further assistance.
Multiple Scalers: Choose between different data preprocessing methods (StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler) for feature scaling.
Customizable Input: Farmers can input key environmental factors such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
Technologies Used
Frontend & Backend: Streamlit (Python)
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn for building and deploying the machine learning model.
Data Storage: Pickle for loading the pre-trained model and scalers.
Visualization: Streamlitâ€™s built-in components for displaying data and prediction results.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-prediction-streamlit.git
cd crop-prediction-streamlit
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit application:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Usage
Once the application is running, you can navigate to the home page, input environmental parameters such as:

Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) levels
Temperature (Â°C)
Humidity (%)
pH level
Rainfall (mm)
Click on the Predict button to get a recommendation for the most suitable crop to cultivate.

Model and Data
Model: The machine learning model is built using a Decision Tree Classifier.
Scalers: You can choose between StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler to preprocess your data before prediction.
Crop Mapping: The system can recommend a wide variety of crops such as Rice, Maize, Cotton, Jute, Coconut, Mango, and many more.
Future Enhancements
Mobile-friendly Interface: Improve the UI to be more responsive for mobile users.
Geolocation-based Suggestions: Automatically recommend crops based on the userâ€™s location.
Real-time Weather Integration: Use APIs to fetch real-time weather data for more accurate predictions.
